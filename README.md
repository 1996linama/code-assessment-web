# Work & Co Shopping Cart

## Description
A functional shopping cart built using Javascript, React, and Bootstrap.

## Background
Completed by Lina Ma (@1996linama) for Work & Co.

## Status
Completed.

## Development Process

### Goals
My priority was to build a minimial viable product first before implementing the web design. 

My process began with creating a functional shopping cart.

### UI Process
#### UI Framework choice
<p>
I chose Bootstrap for being reknown for building a responsive layout and my familarity with the library.
In order to implement the UI with Bootstrap, I had to upgrade React and other dependencies to the most recent version available.
</p>

####Diversions from initial UI design
<p>
Instead of having a master update button that updates all the quantities of all the products in the cart, which would require a check for if the quantity is available in the inventory stock, I decided to implement
an automatic quantity update if the user increases or decreases the quantity in the cart. The button is disabled if the quantity reaches the max inventory stock.
